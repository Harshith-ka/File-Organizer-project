File Management & Organizing Simulator

A Python Flask-based web application that lets you upload, organize, rename, delete, and manage files effortlessly. The app automatically categorizes files by type and even extracts .zip files to organize their contents. Perfect for anyone looking to simulate a desktop-like file management experience in the browser.

Music (.mp3, .wav, .m4a)

Videos (.mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov)

Applications (.exe, .msi, .apk)

Compressed (.zip, .rar, .7z)

Others (any uncategorized files)

Automatic extraction: .zip files are extracted, and their contents are categorized.

Rename & Delete files: Easily rename or delete files directly from the UI.

Visual file dashboard: Browse files with a clean, responsive, card-style interface.
